            <p className="about-text">Porto was created with the idea that artists, creators, coders, and everyone with something to show should have an organized,
               fun place to showcase their work. We took the attractiveness of social media and applied it to a real-world need! Now, you
               can confidently show off your own portfolio by simply creating a profile and submitting the projects you're most proud of,
               to-date.
